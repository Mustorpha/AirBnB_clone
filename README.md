PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The ALX Full-Stack Software Engineer program includes this team project. This is a clone of AirBnB, the first step towards creating a complete web application. A unique command-line interface for data administration and base classes for data storage make up this initial step.

Command Interpreter:
A command interpreter is a tool that allows users to interact with your system through commands entered via the command line
A command interpreter, often referred to as a shell or CLI (Command Line Interface), is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer program by typing commands.

How to Start:
To start the command interpreter, open a terminal or command prompt on the system and then execute the command interpreter program. This could involve running a specific script or executable

How to Use it:
Users interact with the command interpreter by entering commands and arguments. Here are some general steps on how users might use your interpreter:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your command interpreter is located.
Run the command interpreter.
Enter commands and provide any necessary arguments.


Examples:
Examples of commands users might use in your Airbnb command interpreter could include:

search <location> <start_date> <end_date>: Searches for available listings in a specific location and date range.
book <listing_id> <start_date> <end_date>: Books a specific listing for a given date range.
listings: Displays a list of available listings.
user_info <user_id>: Retrieves information about a specific user.
The specific commands and syntax will depend on the features implemented in website and how you want users to interact with it via the command line.
